QUBA - Spectroscopy pre-reductions.
===================================

PROGRAM NAME: qubprephot_v2.py 
DATE: 05th May 2009

PURPOSE: Pipeline to do pre-reductions steps for photommetry. Version 4
works for the following Instrument/Telescope setups.

WHT/AUX
TNG/Dolores
NOT/Alfosc

####################################################################################
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   WARNING   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
THIS IS A PIPELINE BUT SHOULD NOT TO BE USED ENTIRELY AS A BLACK BOX. 
OFTEN TEST IMAGES ARE TAKEN DURING THE NIGHT AND SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CHECK THAT THE 
CALIBRATION FILES THE PIPELINE USES ARE THE APPROPRIATE ONES.
####################################################################################


The following notes assumes you are running the pipeline from QUB ARC
computers.

#######Getting Started#############
You should source quba or set an alias in your .tcshrc file

source /home/sne/bin/qubastart_tcsh or export /home/sne/bin/qubastart_bash
eg setting alias: alias quba source /home/sne/bin/qubastart_tcsh

You need to have only one nights observations in a directory in your scratch or
home space.eg $USERPATH/data

ie. > cd $USERPATH/data/

Prior to running this program. The following program should be used to separate
photometric and spectroscopic data.

Create input list for qubareduorganize.py

> ls *.fits > lista
lista is the input file for qubareduorganize.py. It should contain only raw spectral
frames.

If quba sourced 
>qubareduorganize lista

OR if quba not sourced

> /home/sne/QUBA/site-packages/pipeline/bin/qubareduorganize.py @lista

This separates the photometry and spectroscopy related files in to different
folders. It also checks which files are good or not. If it doesn't recognise a
file type it will display this in ds9 and ask you what type of file it is. You
will get the options below:
BIAS [1] IMAGE [2] SPECTRUM [3] or NOT GOOD [4] ? [0] 4

mostly this occurs for images which are corrypt and best to use option 4.

Do an 'ls' on your $USERPATH/data/ directory.
>ls $USERPATH/data/

Aside from the raw data files you should now have two directories
qubaimages and qubaspectra. The reductions for each should be carried out in the
appropriate directory. Bias frames are copied to both directories. This also
removes any frames which cannot be opened by iraf eg. null frames.


#########Spectral pre-reductions#############

> cd $USERPATH/data/qubaspectra

Create input list for qubccdreduc_v3.py

> ls *.fits > lista

lista is the input file for qubaccdreduc. It should contain only raw spectral
frames.

If quba sourced 
>qubaccdreduc @lista

OR if quba not sourced

> /home/sne/QUBA/site-packages/pipeline/bin/qubaccdreduc_v3.py @lista

A log file is open and written to qubaccdreduc.log 

STEP1: Preparing lists
==========================
The program first checks all files are creates lists of flats, bias, arcs,
science frames. In the early stages you should check that these are appropriate
as they are organised using Keywords and these can be tempermental.
These should produce files such as
arclist_[DATE]_[TELESCOPE]
flatlist_[DATE]_[TELESCOPE]
biaslist_[DATE]_[TELESCOPE]
objlist_[DATE]_[TELESCOPE]

STEP2: Preparing lists contd.
==============================
The flat and arc frames will then be split in to lists depending on the grism
and slitwidths you should now have files such as
flatlist_[grism]
arclist_[grism]_[slitw]

The bias and flat field files are then split into files depending on time, as
multiple groups of flats and biases can be taken during the night. Usually at
the beginning and end. These are numbered 1 to x and you get something like:
biaslist_[DATE]_[TELESCOPE]_1
biaslist_[DATE]_[TELESCOPE]_2
flatlist_[grism]_1
flatlist_[grism]_2

This accounts for nodichroic and dichroic for the WHT and is recorded in the
naming of the files.

###STEP3:Creating Masterbias
=============================
All bias files are used to create masterbiases. If the stddev is too large a
file will be omitted. The biases are combined using the median. If there are
less than 3 biases in the file you will be asked if you want to create a bias.
This is up to you, generally these are test biases and not worth it. Default
answer is n.

LESS THAN 3 BIASES DO YOU STILL WANT TO CONTINUE? [y/n]

STEP4: Timming, debiasing, flatfielding
=========================================
Once completed the object file will be read and for each object the code checks
for wether or not there is a bias, arc and flat available in the directory
with the same set up. You can have different outcomes:

STATUS=0) If there is an appropriate bias,arc and flat are available in the directory it will
carryout the reductions with theses

STATUS=-1)If there is a bias and flat field in the directory but no arc with the same slit
it will say that there is an arc but with different slit and will display them
for you to check if you want to use one. 

Bias, Flat available in this directory !!
Warning: arc not available with the same slit
checking if arc available with a different slit......
['LR-B']
arclist_LR-R_1.5_arcsec
arclist_20071216_TNG
arclist_VHR-V_1.5_arcsec
Do you want to use an arc from one of these lists [y/n]? [y]             

if you answer n then it will check the archive if no appropriate arc is
available it will not reduce the object but will create a file with 
[objname]_[grism]_[slitw]_x.fits. x being the number of the exposures for the
object.


IF STATUS=0 it will select and trim the masterbias and create a masterflat.
It selects the closest in time masterbias frame to the observation.
It will tell you the default trim parameters and ask you if you want to change
them. 
#### trim        =  [70:2090,50:1200]
#### overscan    =  [1:2100,2060:2100]

Do you want to select different trim and overscan [y,n] ? [n]

If you enter 'y' it will display the frame and you can use iraf/imexam to check
out the parameters you want. After using 'q' to exit imexam mode you will be
asked to input new values. this must be done withe the iraf format shown above.

If you enter 'n' it will trim everything with these values.
It first trims the masterbias and creates the file 't'+masterbias

Next it will search for the nearest in time file of flats. It will then combine
these and create a masterflat unless one already exists with the same setup in
the directory.

If the object has the same setup as the previous object it will just use the
flat from that setup

After trimming and debiassing the flat it will ask you wether or not you wish to
normalise the flat. For spectroscopy it is unwise not to.

DO YOU WISH TO NORMALISE THE MASTERFLAT (only say yes for spectra)[y/n] [y]

This brings you into iraf/response interactive mode. To change the order of the
fit enter ':o xx' where xx is the order number. enter 'f' to fit the polynomial.
'q' to exit.

It will then trim, debias, and flatfield the object and nearest in time arc to
the object with the trimmed masterbias and flatfield.

The output is then the [objname]_[grism]_[slitw]_x.fits. x being the number of
the exposures for the object.

After each object you have the option to exit or not.

Do you want to pre-reduce next object [y/n] ? [y]  
if 'y' then it will continue to reduce the next object.
if 'n' it will ask wether or not you wish to exit the program.
Do you want to terminate the reduction process [y/n] ? [y]


If you manage to exit cleanly you should obtain the following message:
END OF CCD REDUCTION
